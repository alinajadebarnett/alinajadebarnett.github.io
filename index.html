    <p>I am a postdoctoral research associate advised by Cynthia Rudin at Duke University. In September 2023, I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Duke University Department of Computer Science where I was advised by professor Cynthia Rudin. I research interpretable deep learning for computer vision with applications in clinical medicine. My work has been featured in NeurIPS (spotlight), New England Journal of Medicine AI, CVPR (IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference), Nature Machine Intelligence, and SPIE Medical Imaging. I was PI for a $19,831 grant from the Duke Incubation Fund for interdisciplinary work on interpretable mammogram analysis. I have many academic awards, a long history of service positions and two competitive Canadian national research awards. I am also a classical musician, active community volunteer and former varsity coxswain.</p>
